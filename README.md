After building out thousands of neural nets and facing the same annoying bottlenecks of chaotic codebases with no modularity and low performance modules, Zeta needed to be born to enable me and others to quickly prototype, train, and optimize the latest SOTA neural nets and deploy them into production. 

Zeta places a radical emphasis on useability, modularity, and performance. Zeta is now currently employed in 100s of models across my github and across others. 
Get started below and LMK if you want my help building any model, I'm here for you 😊 💜 


# Install

```bash
$ pip3 install -U zetascale
```

# Usage

## Starting Your Journey

Creating a model empowered with the aforementioned breakthrough research features is a breeze. Here's how to quickly materialize the renowned Multi Query Attention

```python
import torch
from zeta import MultiQueryAttention

# Model
model = MultiQueryAttention(
    dim=512,
    heads=8,
)

# Input
text = torch.randn(2, 4, 512)

# Output
output, _, _ = model(text)
print(output.shape)
print(output)

```



### `SwiGLU`
The SwiGLU activation function takes an input tensor and applies a gating mechanism to selectively pass information. It consists of two parts: the "switch" gate and the "glu" gate. The switch gate controls the flow of information, while the glu gate performs a non-linear transformation on the input.


```python
import torch

from zeta.nn import SwiGLUStacked

x = torch.randn(5, 10)
swiglu = SwiGLUStacked(10, 20)
swiglu(x).shape
```

In this example, we first import the necessary modules, including torch for tensor operations and SwiGLUStacked from zeta.nn for the SwiGLU activation function.

We then create a random input tensor x with a shape of (5, 10). Next, we instantiate an instance of SwiGLUStacked with an input size of 10 and an output size of 20.

Finally, we pass the input tensor x to the swiglu module, which applies the SwiGLU activation function to it. The resulting output tensor is stored in the output variable. We print the shape of the output tensor to see the

### RelativePositionBias
- `RelativePositionBias` quantizes the distance between two positions into a certain number of buckets and then uses an embedding to get the relative position bias. This mechanism aids in the attention mechanism by providing biases based on relative positions between the query and key, rather than relying solely on their absolute positions.

```python
import torch
from torch import nn

from zeta.nn import RelativePositionBias

# Initialize the RelativePositionBias module
rel_pos_bias = RelativePositionBias()

# Example 1: Compute bias for a single batch
bias_matrix = rel_pos_bias(1, 10, 10)


# Example 2: Utilize in conjunction with an attention mechanism
# NOTE: This is a mock example, and may not represent an actual attention mechanism's complete implementation.
class MockAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.rel_pos_bias = RelativePositionBias()

    def forward(self, queries, keys):
        bias = self.rel_pos_bias(queries.size(0), queries.size(1), keys.size(1))
        # Further computations with bias in the attention mechanism...
        return None  # Placeholder


# Example 3: Modify default configurations
custom_rel_pos_bias = RelativePositionBias(
    bidirectional=False, num_buckets=64, max_distance=256, num_heads=8
)
```

### `FeedForward`
The FeedForward module performs a feedforward operation on the input tensor x. It consists of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with an optional activation function and LayerNorm. 
Used in most language, multi-modal, and modern neural networks.

```python
import torch

from zeta.nn import FeedForward

model = FeedForward(256, 512, glu=True, post_act_ln=True, dropout=0.2)

x = torch.randn(1, 256)

output = model(x)
print(output.shape)
```

### `BitLinear`
- The BitLinear module performs linear transformation on the input data, followed by quantization and dequantization. The quantization process is performed using the absmax_quantize function, which quantizes the input tensor based on the absolute maximum value, [from the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11453)
```python
import torch
from torch import nn

import zeta.quant as qt


class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = qt.BitLinear(10, 20)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)


# Initialize the model
model = MyModel()

# Create a random tensor of size (128, 10)
input = torch.randn(128, 10)

# Perform the forward pass
output = model(input)

# Print the size of the output
print(output.size())  # torch.Size([128, 20])
```

### `PalmE`
- This is an implementation of the multi-modal Palm-E model using a decoder llm as the backbone with an VIT image encoder to process vision, it's very similiar to GPT4, Kosmos, RTX2, and many other multi-modality model architectures

```python
import torch

from zeta.structs import (
    AutoRegressiveWrapper,
    Decoder,
    Encoder,
    Transformer,
    ViTransformerWrapper,
)

### `Unet`
Unet is a famous convolutional neural network architecture originally used for biomedical image segmentation but soon became the backbone of the generative AI Mega-revolution. The architecture comprises two primary pathways: downsampling and upsampling, followed by an output convolution. Due to its U-shape, the architecture is named U-Net. Its symmetric architecture ensures that the context (from downsampling) and the localization (from upsampling) are captured effectively.

```python
import torch

from zeta.nn import Unet

# Initialize the U-Net model
model = Unet(n_channels=1, n_classes=2)

# Random input tensor with dimensions [batch_size, channels, height, width]
x = torch.randn(1, 1, 572, 572)

# Forward pass through the model
y = model(x)

# Output
print(f"Input shape: {x.shape}")
print(f"Output shape: {y.shape}")
```


### `VisionEmbeddings`
The VisionEmbedding class is designed for converting images into patch embeddings, making them suitable for processing by transformer-based models. This class plays a crucial role in various computer vision tasks and enables the integration of vision data into transformer architectures!

```python
import torch

from zeta.nn import VisionEmbedding

# Create an instance of VisionEmbedding
vision_embedding = VisionEmbedding(
    img_size=224,
    patch_size=16,
    in_chans=3,
    embed_dim=768,
    contain_mask_token=True,
    prepend_cls_token=True,
)

# Load an example image (3 channels, 224x224)
input_image = torch.rand(1, 3, 224, 224)

# Perform image-to-patch embedding
output = vision_embedding(input_image)

# The output now contains patch embeddings, ready for input to a transformer model
```


### `niva`
- Niva focuses on weights of certain layers (specified by quantize_layers). Ideal for models where runtime activation is variable. 👁️ Example Layers: nn.Embedding, nn.LSTM. 

```python
import torch

from zeta import niva

# Load a pre-trained model
model = YourModelClass()

# Quantize the model dynamically, specifying layers to quantize
niva(
    model=model,
    model_path="path_to_pretrainedim_weights.pt",
    output_path="quantizedim.pt",
    quant_type="dynamic",
    quantize_layers=[nn.Linear, nn.Conv2d],
    dtype=torch.qint8,
)
```


### `FusedDenseGELUDense`
- Increase model speed by 2x with this module that fuses together 2 hyper-optimized dense ops from bits and bytes and a gelu together!

```python
import torch

from zeta.nn import FusedDenseGELUDense

x = torch.randn(1, 512)
model = FusedDenseGELUDense(512, 1024)
out = model(x)
out.shape
```


### `FusedDropoutLayerNorm`
- FusedDropoutLayerNorm is a fused kernel of dropout and layernorm to speed up FFNs or MLPS by 2X

```python
import torch
from torch import nn

from zeta.nn import FusedDropoutLayerNorm

# Initialize the module
model = FusedDropoutLayerNorm(dim=512)

# Create a sample input tensor
x = torch.randn(1, 512)

# Forward pass
output = model(x)

# Check output shape
print(output.shape)  # Expected: torch.Size([1, 512])
```


### `Mamba`
- Pytorch implementation of the new SSM model architecture Mamba

```python
import torch

from zeta.nn import MambaBlock

# Initialize Mamba
block = MambaBlock(dim=64, depth=1)

# Random input
x = torch.randn(1, 10, 64)

# Apply the model to the block
y = block(x)

print(y.shape)
# torch.Size([1, 10, 64])
```

### `FiLM`

```python
import torch

from zeta.nn import Film

# Initialize the Film layer
film_layer = Film(dim=128, hidden_dim=64, expanse_ratio=4)

# Create some dummy data for conditions and hiddens
conditions = torch.randn(10, 128)  # Batch size is 10, feature size is 128
hiddens = torch.randn(
    10, 1, 128
)  # Batch size is 10, sequence length is 1, feature size is 128

# Pass the data through the Film layer
modulated_features = film_layer(conditions, hiddens)

# Print the shape of the output
print(modulated_features.shape)  # Should be [10, 1, 128]
```

### `hyper_optimize`
- A single wrapper for torch.fx, torch.script, torch.compile, dynamic quantization, mixed precision through torch.amp, with execution time metrics all in once place!

from zeta.nn import hyper_optimize


@hyper_optimize(
    torch_fx=False,
    torch_script=False,
    torch_compile=True,
    quantize=True,
    mixed_precision=True,
    enable_metrics=True,
)
def model(x):
    return x @ x


out = model(torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32))
print(out)
```


### DPO - Direct Policy Optimization
Direct Policy Optimization employed for many RLHF applications for LLMs.

```python
import torch
from torch import nn

from zeta.rl import DPO


# Define a simple policy model
class PolicyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, output_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(input_dim, output_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)


input_dim = 10
output_dim = 5
policy_model = PolicyModel(input_dim, output_dim)

# Initialize DPO with the policy model
dpo_model = DPO(model=policy_model, beta=0.1)

# Sample preferred and unpreferred sequences
preferred_seq = torch.randint(0, output_dim, (3, input_dim))
unpreferred_seq = torch.randint(0, output_dim, (3, input_dim))

# Compute loss
loss = dpo_model(preferred_seq, unpreferred_seq)
print(loss)
```
