class AverageModelMerger:

    A class to merge multiple models by averaging their weights.

    This is a simple yet effective method to combine models trained in different stages
    (like instruction and alignment tuning) to potentially boost performance.

    Examples::
    # Example usage:
    model1 = nn.Linear(in_features=10, out_features=10)
    model2 = nn.Linear(in_features=10, out_features=10)
