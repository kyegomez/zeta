# LocalTransformer

## Introduction

The `LocalTransformer` is a powerful machine learning module that implements a sequence-to-sequence model based on the local self-attention module part of the Transformer architecture. This module is specifically designed for applications where sequences of tokens are transformed, such as natural language processing tasks. 

At a high level, a transformer takes in a sequence of tokens and outputs a new sequence of tokens. Local transformer creates a module where attention is based on a limited window of the input sequence which can be beneficial for both efficiency and model performance in certain cases.

## Definitions and Key Concepts

- **tokens**: Individual elements of a sequence, typically words in a sentence for language tasks.
- **sequence length**: The number of tokens in each sequence.
- **embeddings**: Vector representations of tokens, which allow them to be processed by the network.
- **attention**: A mechanism in transformers that allows the model to focus on different parts of the input when producing each part of the output. 

## Class Definition

The class signature for the `LocalTransformer` is as follows:

```
class LocalTransformer(nn.Module):
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| num_tokens | int | The number of tokens in the input vocabulary. | - |
| max_seq_len | int | The maximum sequence length. | - |
| dim | int | The dimensionality of the token and positional embeddings. | - |
| depth | int | The number of transformer layers. | - |
| causal | bool | Whether to use causal attention or not. | True |
| local_attn_window_size | int | The size of the local attention window. | 512 |
| dim_head | int | The dimensionality of each attention head. | 64 |
| heads | int | The number of attention heads. | 8 |
| ff_mult | int | The multiplier for the feedforward network dimension. | 4 |
| attn_dropout | float | The dropout rate for attention layers. | 0.1 |
| ff_dropout | float | The dropout rate for feedforward layers. | 0.1 |
| ignore_index | int | The index to ignore during loss calculation. | -1 |
| use_xpos | bool | Whether to use positional embeddings based on xpos. | False |
| xpos_scale_base | None | The base value for scaling xpos positional embeddings. | None |
| use_dynamic_pos_bias | bool | Whether to use dynamic positional bias or not. | False |


### Understanding Arguments
    
- **num_tokens**: This determines the size of the vocabulary. This is set according to the dataset and cannot be modified post initialization.
- **max_seq_len**: This sets the maximum sequence length. As the model would need to create key, query and values for each token, increasing this value can lead to a significant increase in memory usage.
- **dim**: This is the size of the model's embeddings. The higher this value, the more information each embedding can store. However, similarly to max_seq_len, this can also drastically increase memory usage. 
- **depth**: This corresponds to the number of layers the model will have. Deeper models can potentially have better representative power, but it can also lead to overfitting and longer training times.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| token_emb | Embedding layer for token embeddings. |
| pos_emb | Embedding layer for positional embeddings. |
| max_seq_len | The maximum sequence length. |
| layers | List of transformer layers. |
| local_attn_window_size | The size of the local attention window. |
| dynamic_pos_bias | Dynamic positional bias layer, if enabled. |
| ignore_index | The index to ignore during loss calculation. |
| to_logits | Sequential layer for converting transformer output to logits. |

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to initialize and use the `LocalTransformer` class for a simple task:

```python
import torch

from zeta.structs import LocalTransformer

# Define a LocalTransformer
model = LocalTransformer(num_tokens=500, max_seq_len=10, dim=32, depth=2)

# Define a simple sequence
sequence = torch.randint(0, 500, (1, 10))

# Forward pass
output = model(sequence)
```

This will create a `LocalTransformer` model with a vocabulary of size 500, a maximum sequence length of 10, an embedding dimension of 32, and 2 transformer layers. It then performs a forward pass of the sequence through the model, outputting the transformed sequence.

## Conclusion

The `LocalTransformer` module is a highly flexible and modular implementation of the transformer architecture, equipped with local attention. Given its configurable nature, it is amenable to various NLP and sequence-to-sequence modeling tasks. An understanding of its input arguments, attributes, and overall design is essential to leverage its full potential.
