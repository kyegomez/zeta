## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Welcome to the Zeta documentation for the `TransformerBlock` class! Zeta is a versatile library that offers tools for efficient training of deep learning models using PyTorch. This documentation will provide a comprehensive overview of the `TransformerBlock` class, its architecture, purpose, and usage.

## 2. Purpose and Functionality <a name="purpose-and-functionality"></a>

The `TransformerBlock` class is a fundamental component of the Zeta library. It is designed to be used within a transformer-based architecture, and its primary purpose is to process input data efficiently. Below, we'll explore the key functionalities and features of the `TransformerBlock` class.

---

## 3. Class: `TransformerBlock` <a name="class-transformerblock"></a>

The `TransformerBlock` class is the building block of transformer-based models. It performs various operations, including multi-head attention and feedforward network, to process input data. Let's dive into the details of this class.

### Initialization <a name="initialization"></a>

To create a `TransformerBlock` instance, you need to specify various parameters and configurations. Here's an example of how to initialize it:

```python
TransformerBlock(
    dim=512,
    dim_head=64,
    causal=True,
    heads=8,
    qk_rmsnorm=False,
    qk_scale=8,
    ff_mult=4,
    attn_dropout=0.1,
    ff_dropout=0.1,
    use_xpos=True,
    xpos_scale_base=512,
    flash_attn=False,
)
```

### Parameters <a name="parameters"></a>

- `dim` (int): The dimension of the input data.

- `dim_head` (int): The dimension of each attention head.

- `causal` (bool): Whether to use a causal (auto-regressive) attention mechanism. Default is `True`.

- `heads` (int): The number of attention heads. 

- `qk_rmsnorm` (bool): Whether to apply root mean square normalization to query and key vectors. Default is `False`.

- `qk_scale` (int): Scaling factor for query and key vectors. Used when `qk_rmsnorm` is `True`. Default is `8`.

- `ff_mult` (int): Multiplier for the feedforward network dimension. Default is `4`.

- `attn_dropout` (float): Dropout probability for attention layers. Default is `0.1`.

- `ff_dropout` (float): Dropout probability for the feedforward network. Default is `0.1`.

- `use_xpos` (bool): Whether to use positional embeddings. Default is `True`.

- `xpos_scale_base` (int): Scaling factor for positional embeddings. Default is `512`.

- `flash_attn` (bool): Whether to use Flash Attention mechanism. Default is `False`.

### Attention Mechanism <a name="attention-mechanism"></a>

The `TransformerBlock` class includes a powerful attention mechanism that allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input data. It supports both regular and Flash Attention.

### Multi-Head Attention <a name="multi-head-attention"></a>

The class can split the attention mechanism into multiple heads, allowing the model to capture different patterns in the data simultaneously. The number of attention heads is controlled by the `heads` parameter.

### Rotary Embedding <a name="rotary-embedding"></a>

Rotary embeddings are used to enhance the model's ability to handle sequences of different lengths effectively. They are applied to query and key vectors to improve length extrapolation.

### Feedforward Network <a name="feedforward-network"></a>

The `TransformerBlock` class includes a feedforward network that processes the attention output. It can be customized by adjusting the `ff_mult` parameter.

### Caching and Optimization <a name="caching-and-optimization"></a>

The class includes mechanisms for caching causal masks and rotary embeddings, which can improve training efficiency. It also provides options for fine-tuning specific modules within the block.

## 4. Usage Examples <a name="usage-examples"></a>

Now, let's explore some usage examples of the `TransformerBlock` class to understand how to use it effectively.

### Basic Usage <a name="basic-usage"></a>

```python
# Create a TransformerBlock instance
transformer_block = TransformerBlock(dim=512, heads=8)

# Process input data
output = transformer_block(input_data)
```

### Fine-Tuning <a name="fine-tuning"></a>

```python
# Create a TransformerBlock instance with fine-tuning modules
lora_q = YourCustomModule()
lora_k = YourCustomModule()
lora_v = YourCustomModule()
lora_o = YourCustomModule()

transformer_block = TransformerBlock(
    dim=512, heads=8, finetune_modules=(lora_q, lora_k, lora_v, lora_o)
)

# Process input data
output = transformer_block(input_data)
```

## 5. Additional Information <a name="additional-information"></a>

### Layernorm <a name="layernorm"></a>

The `TransformerBlock` class uses layer normalization (layernorm) to normalize input data before processing. This helps stabilize and accelerate training.

### Position Embeddings <a name="position-embeddings"></a>

Position embeddings are used to provide the model with information about the position of tokens

 in the input sequence. They are crucial for handling sequences of different lengths effectively.
