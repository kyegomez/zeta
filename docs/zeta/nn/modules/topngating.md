# Module/Function Name: TopNGating


## 1. Purpose and Functionality

The `TopNGating` module serves as a mechanism to perform routing to top-n experts during a training or evaluation phase. It implements a method to compute the dispatch tensor, balance losses, and the router z-loss, and aligns the input sequences based on the experts' mini-batch. The routing is governed by various parameters including thresholds, capacity factors, gate logits for differentiable top-k operations, and more.

## 2. Overview and Introduction

The `TopNGating` module is essential for scenarios that demand routing to top experts to effectively process input sequences. By providing a means for fine-grained control over the assignment of sequences to different experts, it enhances the overall performance of the processing pipeline.

## 3. Class Definition

```python
class TopNGating(Module):
    def __init__(
        self,
        dim,
        num_gates,
        eps=1e-9,
        top_n=2,
        threshold_train: Union[float, Tuple[float, ...]] = 0.2,
        threshold_eval: Union[float, Tuple[float, ...]] = 0.2,
        capacity_factor_train=1.25,
        capacity_factor_eval=2.0,
        straight_through_dispatch_tensor=True,
        differentiable_topk=False,
        differentiable_topk_fused=True,
        min_expert_capacity: int = 4,
    ):
def forward(self, x, noise_gates=False, noise_mult=1.0):
```

## 4. Functionality and Usage

The `forward` method within the `TopNGating` class encapsulates the core functionality of the module. It accepts an input tensor `x` and various optional parameters for configuring the routing mechanism such as noise for the gates, noise multiplier, and performs the computation to obtain the dispatch tensor, combine tensor, balance loss, and router z-loss.

We will now illustrate the usage of the `TopNGating` module through code examples.

### Usage Example 1:

```python
import torch
from zeta.nn import TopNGating

x = torch.randn(1, 2, 3)
model = TopNGating(3, 4)
out, _, _, _, = model(x)
print(out.shape)
```

### Usage Example 2:

```python
import torch
from zeta.nn import TopNGating

x = torch.randn(2, 3, 4)
model = TopNGating(4, 3, top_n=3)
out, _, _, _, = model(x, noise_gates=True, noise_mult=0.7)
print(out.shape)
```

### Usage Example 3:

```python
import torch
from zeta.nn import TopNGating

x = torch.randn(2, 5, 6)
model = TopNGating(6, 5, threshold_train=(0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.35), threshold_eval=(0.21, 0.31, 0.41, 0.36))
out, _, _, _, = model(x, noise_gates=True, noise_mult=0.8)
print(out.shape)
```

## 5. Additional Information and Tips

- Developers or users leveraging the `TopNGating` module should be cautious while configuring the different settings related to gating thresholds, capacity factors, and the added noise. These parameters can significantly impact the routing mechanism. It's advisable to perform multiple iterations with varying parameters to observe performance differences.
