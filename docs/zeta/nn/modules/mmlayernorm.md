# Module/Function Name: MMLayerNorm

```python
# Usage example:
import torch
from zeta.nn import MMLayerNorm

mm_ln = MMLayerNorm(num_modalities=2, dim=64)
modality1 = torch.randn(32, 10, 64)
modality2 = torch.randn(32, 10, 64)
mm_ln([modality1, modality2])
print(mm_ln)
```

Explanation:

The `MMLayerNorm` class represents a Multi-Modality Layer Normalization module that fuses and normalizes input tensors from different modalities. It helps in combining and normalizing information extracted from different sources, like images, text, etc.

The parameters are as follows:
- `num_modalities` (int): The number of modalities to be fused.
- `dim` (int): The dimension of the input tensors.
- `epsilon` (float): A small value added to the denominator for numerical stability. Default value is 1e-5.

The `MMLayerNorm` class contains a method called `forward` that takes a list of input tensors representing different modalities and returns the output tensor after fusing and normalizing the modalities.

The usage example demonstrates how to instantiate the `MMLayerNorm` class and pass input tensors to obtain the fused and normalized output tensor.

**Note**: Ensure that the shapes of all the input modalities are identical. All modalities must have the same shape in order to perform fusion and normalization.

This code snippet can be used to create and use a Multi-Modality Layer Normalization module in neural network architectures that require combining input tensors from different modalities for processing. The class structure ensures that submodules are registered and their parameters are converted as expected.
