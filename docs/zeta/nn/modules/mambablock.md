# Module/Function Name: MambaBlock

### Overview and Introduction
The MambaBlock class provides a simple yet effective block for deep learning designed to enrich the memory state in neural networks. It's part of the zeta.nn.modules library and is specially designed to increase the temporal dependencies in neural networks. The MambaBlock allows to examine the neural network's output not only from the perspective of spatial dependence but from a temporal one as well. This means it takes into account the history or sequence of data leading up to the present time.
