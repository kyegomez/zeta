# Module/Function Name: UMambaBlock

UMambaBlock is a 5d Mamba block designed to serve as a building block for 5d visual models. In accordance with the article published on https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04722.pdf, this module enables transformation across 5D space-time data for efficient information processing.

The module's core concepts pertain to the input dimension (dim), the depth of the Mamba block, the state dimension (d_state), the expansion factor (expand), the rank of the temporal difference (dt_rank), the dimension of the convolutional kernel (d_conv), and the inclusion of bias in linear and convolutional layers.

## Detailed Explanation:
The UMambaBlock class serves as a thorough representation of a 5d Mamba block. It encapsulates the input dimension, depth, state dimension, expansion factor, and other key parameters. By instantiating this block, users can process 5D visual data, further taking advantage of hyperparameters to customize the block for specific application requirements.

## Usage Examples:
### Example 1:
```python
import torch
from zeta.nn import UMambaBlock

# img:         B, C, H, W, D
img_tensor = torch.randn(1, 64, 10, 10, 10)

# Initialize Mamba block
block = UMambaBlock(dim=64, depth=1)

# Forward pass
y = block(img_tensor)
print(y.shape)
```

### Example 2:
```python
import torch
from zeta.nn import UMambaBlock

# img:         B, C, H, W, D
img_tensor = torch.randn(1, 64, 10, 10, 10)

# Initialize Mamba block with custom parameters
block = UMambaBlock(dim=64, depth=3, expand=3)

# Forward pass
y = block(img_tensor)
print(y.shape)
```

### Example 3:
```python
import torch
from zeta.nn import UMambaBlock

# img:         B, C, H, W, D
img_tensor = torch.randn(1, 64, 5, 5, 20)

# Initialize Mamba block with altered state dimension and convolutional kernel size
block = UMambaBlock(dim=64, d_state=32, d_conv=6)

# Forward pass
y = block(img_tensor)
print(y.shape)
```

## Additional Information and Tips:
The user may benefit from customizing various hyperparameters such as the input dimension, depth, and state dimension to tailor the UMambaBlock for specific use cases. Common useful tips include managing the Mamba block's rank parameter and identifying key transformations to optimize for handling high-dimensional spatiotemporal data.
