# QloraLinear Layer Documentation

The QloraLinear layer is an innovative approach to linear transformation in deep learning. The core idea behind QloraLinear is to utilize both the traditional linear transformation and an additional mechanism known as QLoRA (Quantum Linear Representation Approximation). This document provides a comprehensive guide to understanding, utilizing, and testing the QloraLinear layer.

## Introduction

Neural networks are often composed of linear transformations followed by non-linear activations. However, as models grow in complexity and depth, researchers are constantly exploring ways to enhance the expressiveness of individual layers. QloraLinear is one such exploration, introducing quantum-inspired principles to enhance the linear transformation process.

## Overview of QloraLinear Layer

### Purpose

The primary purpose of the QloraLinear layer is to perform a linear transformation on the input data. However, it introduces an additional term, QLoRA, that captures joint information representation from different subspaces, enhancing the expressiveness of the transformation.

### Architecture

QloraLinear comprises two main components:

1. **Traditional Linear Transformation**: This is similar to the standard linear layer in neural networks. The input data is multiplied by a weight matrix to produce the output.
2. **QLoRA Transformation**: A quantum-inspired term added to the standard linear transformation. It is represented as a product of two matrices, `lora_A` and `lora_B`, scaled by a factor. This term introduces additional expressiveness to the layer.

## Class Definition and Parameters

The QloraLinear layer is defined as:

```python
class QloraLinear(nn.Module):
```

### Parameters

| Parameter     | Type         | Description                                                       |
|---------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| in_features   | int          | Size of each input sample.                                        |
| out_features  | int          | Size of each output sample.                                       |
| weight        | torch.Tensor | Weight tensor of shape (out_features, in_features).               |
| r             | int          | Number of blocks to use for QLoRA.                                |
| lora_alpha    | int          | (Optional) Scaling factor for QLoRA. Default: 1.                  |
| lora_dropout  | float        | (Optional) Dropout to apply to the QLoRA term. Default: 0.1.      |

### Methods

- **reset_parameters()**: Initializes the learnable parameters of the QLoRA term.
- **forward(x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor**: Performs the linear transformation.

## Usage Examples

### 1. Basic Instantiation

To instantiate a QloraLinear layer:

```python
import torch.nn as nn

from zeta.quant.qlora import QloraLinear

in_features = 20
out_features = 30
weight = torch.randn(out_features, in_features)
r = 5

layer = QloraLinear(in_features, out_features, weight, r)
```

### 2. Forward Pass

Performing a forward pass through the layer:

```python
import torch

input_data = torch.randn(128, in_features)
output_data = layer(input_data)
```

### 3. With Dropout

If you want to introduce dropout to the QLoRA term:

```python
lora_alpha = 2
lora_dropout = 0.1

dropout_layer = QloraLinear(
    in_features, out_features, weight, r, lora_alpha, lora_dropout
)
output_with_dropout = dropout_layer(input_data)
```

## Testing the QloraLinear Layer

A suite of tests has been provided to ensure the correctness and reliability of the QloraLinear layer. These tests cover initialization, forward pass calculations, dropout effects, and more.

To run the tests, make sure you have `pytest` installed:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

Then, navigate to the test directory and run:

```bash
pytest tests/quant/qlora.py
```

This will execute all the provided tests, ensuring the layer functions as expected.

## Conclusion

The QloraLinear layer is a powerful addition to the deep learning toolkit. It combines traditional linear transformations with quantum-inspired principles to enhance the expressiveness of neural network layers. Whether you're building a simple feed-forward network or a complex deep learning model, QloraLinear can provide a significant boost in model performance.
